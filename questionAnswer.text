when server receive request we use middleware to verify users authenticity and authorization and according to that server run database query and send response to frontend.

//--Request-Response cycle
Frontend/userend -> sent request -> server receive request -> middleware check authenticity and authorization (if success)-> database access -> response sent back to frontend userend.
